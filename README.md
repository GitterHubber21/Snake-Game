# Snake Game with Pixel-Art Apple

Welcome to the **Snake Game** project! This is a classic snake game built with Python and Pygame, featuring a pixel-art **apple** and support for both **arrow keys** and **WASD controls** . 


---
## Controls

You can control the snake using either the **Arrow Keys** or the **WASD Keys**.

## How It Works

### 1. **Snake Movement** 
- The snake moves in a grid-like fashion, where each move corresponds to a fixed block size.
- You control the snake's direction using the **Arrow Keys** or **WASD Keys**. 

### 2. **Win and Lose Conditions** 
- **Win Condition**: The game ends with a victory message when the snake reaches a length of **20 blocks**.
- **Lose Condition**: The game ends with a game-over message if the snake collides with the wall. 

### 3. **Game Loop** 
- The game continuously checks for user input (key presses) to change the snake's direction.
- The snake is drawn on the screen with each frame, updating its position based on the direction itâ€™s moving.
- The game runs in a loop until the player either wins or loses.
